Our experts in artificial intelligence have helped design an intelligent gym companion that goes beyond conventional personal training. Our team is driven by the belief that everyone deserves access to a customized, effective, and personalized workout routine without the need for a dedicated trainer. Imagine the experience of a personal trainer in an app that completely adapts to your individual needs, requirements, fitness ability and goals.

Start by uploading several photos of yourself to get a fully customized body analysis breakdown to see where your body is lacking and could be improved. Then you can create a custom tailored workout plan that will help you meet your weight and healthy lifestyle goals. If that isn't enough, we also provide you with a complete weekly meal plan that can be adjusted to fit your dietary needs. This is enough to get you started and going on your fitness journey.

Then comes the best part. Now sure what you are doing or unsure if your form is correct? Our real-time feedback video analyzer will let you take a short video of yourself doing an exercise and our intelligent AI will let you know if your form is off or if you are doing the exercise incorrectly.

Make sure to check out QuantumFit today, so we can help you on your journey towards a healthier lifestyle and fitter body.
